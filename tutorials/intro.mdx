:::info Note on the source codes

[NEAR Lake Framework](https://docs.near.org/concepts/advanced/near-lake-framework) is constantly updating. That's why it's not always possible to update the tutorials.

However, we always update the source codes to the latest published version.

The articles where the texts are not updates we put a disclaimer with a warning about the versions.

If you're willing to help with the texts, please [open a Pull Request](https://github.com/near/indexers-docs)
